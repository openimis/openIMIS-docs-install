# Web Application Localisation

If you want to localise openIMIS Web Application component, you will need first to download the source code for the Web Application from [Github](https://github.com/openimis/web_app_vb/releases). 

The .NET Web Application has been developed to be used in different insurance contexts and with the idea of minimal adaptations. Most of the localisation can be realized through database change. However, there are some specific requirements that will have to change the Web Application's source code.
