To configure the database connection string, go in openIMIS root folder (usually C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\openIMIS), locate the web.config file and edit “IMISConnectionString”, so that the connection string points to the database created in openIMIS database section with the right credentials. For example:

.. code-block:: xml
   :linenos:

	<connectionStrings>
		<add name="IMISConnectionString" connectionString="Data Source=WIN-H4E4ARREBFH\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=IMIS;User ID=ImisUser;Password=password1234" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
