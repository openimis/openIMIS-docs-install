Questions like “What is the number of newly covered insurees by an insurance product at during a calendar period and who were of an age, a gender, lived in a location and were cared for by a Enrolment officer? Data in the multidimensional Data Warehouse are presented by a suitable front-end tool. Currently AR-IMIS uses MS Excel as the front-end presentation tool. An Excel file is remotely connected to the Data Warehouse and data are stored in the Excel file in the form of so called pivot tables. The multidimensional model is based on the notion of facts and dimensions. The facts (indicators) are what we are interested in. For example, a fact may number of insured persons, number of active policies, number of submitted claims etc. Facts can be looked at from different angles-for example from the point of view of age and gender of insured persons, from the point of view of time period etc. These angles (points of view) are captured by the notion of dimensions that are used for qualification of facts (:ref:`image272`)."

Points of a dimension may be organized in hierarchies. Higher levels of hierarchies represent more aggregate views. Going to the lower levels by so called *drill down* operation we can analyze facts in more detail-for example we may drill down from calendar years to quarters of corresponding calendar years and further to months. We can go in an opposite direction and look at facts from more aggregate points of view (*drill up*).For example from looking at the amount of collected contributions in calendar months we can look at the same indicator according to quarters of a year or according to calendar years."

Lower levels of a hierarchy allow looking at a fact according to more specific points. For example, the most important *Time* dimension has at the lowest level calendar months. The calendar months are grouped into quarters and quarters into calendar years. So, we can get a value of a fact corresponding to a specific month. Going one level up in the dimension *Time*, we can get can get a value of the fact corresponding to a specific quarter and going even up we can get a value of the fact corresponding to a specific calendar year.
